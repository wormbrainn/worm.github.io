title: a letter to my best friend 
---
I have never felt a sense of belonging. I always look for new places, new people, and a new home. 
We are at a way station right now I don't know where we will be in a few years. sometimes, I feel like I belong here, around my loving friends, around my little brother, 
in the houses of people I love.
You are my sister in so many ways. We have known each other since we were so young, from the day we sat beside each other in class, to the ramen we shared at my place and yours, to getting ready together, to talking about falling in love and wanting to be loved.
I think back to when we were younger, i love having you in my life. You're where I am vulnerable. Secure. 
The world has never been very kind, but you have. Thank you.
